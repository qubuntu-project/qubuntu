# QUBUNTU - Quantum-Safe Linux Distribution

**Protecting the future of digital security with Post-Quantum Cryptography**

QUBUNTU is a planned quantum-safe Linux distribution based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS that implements post-quantum cryptography to protect against future quantum computer threats.

## Mission

Create the first production-ready Linux distribution with built-in post-quantum cryptography, making quantum-safe computing accessible to everyone before quantum computers make current encryption obsolete.

## Core Features (Planned)

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Implementation of ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65, and SHA3-256 encryption standards
- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Base**: Built on stable Ubuntu foundation with long-term support
- **Hardware-Optimized**: Performance-optimized cryptography modules for maximum security
- **Production Ready**: Fully tested distribution for critical environments
- **API Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing Ubuntu ecosystems

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Planning & Funding
- **Seeking**: Development infrastructure funding
- **Base**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Website**: [qubuntu.org](https://qubuntu.org)

## Why QUBUNTU?

Current encryption methods will become vulnerable when quantum computers reach sufficient scale. QUBUNTU proactively implements quantum-resistant security standards to protect digital infrastructure against emerging quantum threats.

## Development Guidelines

- **API Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility during all cryptography updates
- **Post-Quantum Default**: Implement quantum-safe encryption as default with legacy fallback
- **Transparent Development**: Open-source approach with community-driven decisions
- **Security Audits**: Regular security assessments and vulnerability testing

## Funding & Development

This project seeks funding for:
- GitLab server infrastructure
- Development environment setup
- Community building initiatives
- Security audit processes

Part of applications to sustainable open source funding organizations.
