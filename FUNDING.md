- Continuous integration and deployment systems
- Development environment setup and tools

### Security & Quality Assurance
- Third-party security audits of cryptographic implementations
- Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
- Code review by cryptography experts
- Compliance verification with post-quantum standards

### Community Building
- Documentation development and maintenance
- Educational materials and outreach
- Contributor onboarding and support
- Conference participation and presentations

### Technical Resources
- Specialized cryptographic libraries and testing frameworks
- Hardware for performance optimization
- Cloud infrastructure for builds and testing

## Transparency Commitment

All funding and expenses are fully transparent:
- Public financial reporting
- Community oversight of fund allocation
- Regular updates on project progress and spending
- Alignment with open source values and community benefit

## Current Status

QUBUNTU is currently seeking fiscal sponsorship to enable sustainable development and community contributions. We are committed to transparent financial management and community-driven decision making.

## How to Support

We welcome support from individuals, organizations, and institutions who believe in quantum-safe computing for everyone. Details on contributing will be available once our fiscal sponsorship is established.

## Long-term Sustainability

Our goal is to build a self-sustaining project through:
- Community contributions and volunteer development
