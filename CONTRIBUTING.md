# Contributing to QUBUNTU

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QUBUNTU! We welcome contributions from developers, security experts, documentation writers, and anyone passionate about quantum-safe computing.

## Getting Started

QUBUNTU is currently in the planning and early development phase. We're building the foundation for a quantum-safe Linux distribution based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with post-quantum cryptography.

## Ways to Contribute

### Development
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Implementation of ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65, and SHA3-256
- **Ubuntu Integration**: Package analysis and quantum-safe modifications
- **System Architecture**: Core system design and security frameworks
- **Performance Optimization**: Hardware-optimized cryptographic modules

### Security & Research
- **Security Auditing**: Code review and vulnerability assessment
- **Cryptographic Analysis**: Post-quantum algorithm implementation review
- **Testing**: Security testing and penetration testing
- **Standards Compliance**: NIST and FIPS standard verification

### Documentation & Community
- **Technical Documentation**: API documentation, implementation guides
- **User Documentation**: Installation guides, user manuals
- **Educational Content**: Quantum computing threat education, best practices
- **Community Outreach**: Conference presentations, blog posts, tutorials

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing**: Automated testing, integration testing, performance testing
- **Bug Reports**: Issue identification and detailed reporting
- **User Experience**: Interface design and usability improvements

## Development Guidelines

### Security First
- All cryptographic implementations must follow NIST post-quantum standards
- Security considerations must be documented for all changes
- Regular security reviews are required for core components

### API Compatibility
- Maintain compatibility with existing Ubuntu ecosystems
- Implement quantum-safe encryption as default with legacy fallback
- Document all API changes and migration paths

### Code Quality
- Follow established coding standards and best practices
- Include comprehensive tests for new features
- Maintain clear and detailed commit messages
- Ensure all code is properly documented

## Getting Involved

### Current Phase: Planning & Foundation
During this phase, we're focusing on:
- Architecture design and technical specifications
- Community building and contributor onboarding
- Infrastructure setup and development environment
- Initial cryptographic implementation research

### Communication
- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general questions and ideas
- **Email**: Contact info@qubuntu.org for direct communication

## Recognition
